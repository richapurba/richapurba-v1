# richapurba.github.io
A personal website of mine which made for showcase my projects and also myself. Who I am and what I can do can be found in this site.
If you want to use this code repository as your personal website, I have no problem with that as long as you give some credits to me. Please do not change the "Designed and built by Richa Purba" part which linked to my original website in the footer section. I hope that you understand and hope you like my brand new website.
